Groupwise loss function. OneHotMaxSize set to 10
Default metric period is 5 because PFound, RecallAt is/are not implemented for GPU
Metric PFound is not implemented on GPU. Will use CPU for metric computation, this could significantly affect learning time
Metric RecallAt:top=10 is not implemented on GPU. Will use CPU for metric computation, this could significantly affect learning time
